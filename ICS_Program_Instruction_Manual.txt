ICS Worksheet Program - Instruction Manual (Text Version)

Overview

This program is an interactive Incident Command System (ICS) worksheet
designed for Windows desktops, laptops, and tablets. It allows you to
place, move, and manage fire department units, draw on the worksheet,
create notes, save/load layouts, and use a timer — all on top of a
static worksheet background.

This program runs entirely as a local HTML file, meaning: - No
installation required - Works offline - Runs in any modern browser (Edge
recommended)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. How to Save the Program to Your Computer

To ensure the program works correctly:

1.  Save the following files into one folder on your desktop:
    -   ics_board.html (your main program file)
    -   worksheet.png (your worksheet background)
    -   Any .ico file you want to use as the shortcut icon
    -   Any saved JSON layout files (optional)
2.  Make sure the files stay in the same folder, because:
    -   The HTML loads worksheet.png from the same directory
    -   Saved/loaded JSON layouts expect consistent paths
3.  Do NOT move files individually after setting up.
    If you must rename or move things later, move the entire folder.

2. Creating a Desktop Shortcut With Your Custom Icon

1.  Right-click ics_board.html
2.  Select Send to → Desktop (create shortcut)
